Use `AccordionGroup` and `Accordion` for expandable FAQ-style sections.

## Supported props

### `AccordionGroup`

- `defaultOpen?: boolean` - opens the first item initially when `true`
- `children?: ReactNode`

### `Accordion`

- `title?: ReactNode` - item header text/node
- `children?: ReactNode` - item content

## Basic usage

```tsx
<AccordionGroup defaultOpen>
  <Accordion title="What is Shiso?">
    Documentation tooling for Next.js with MDX support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does it support?">
    Docs navigation, metadata, and custom MDX components.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

<AccordionGroup defaultOpen>
  <Accordion title="What is Shiso?">
    Documentation tooling for Next.js with MDX support.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does it support?">
    Docs navigation, metadata, and custom MDX components.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Behavior notes

- empty groups render `null`
- fallback titles are generated as `Section 1`, `Section 2`, ...
