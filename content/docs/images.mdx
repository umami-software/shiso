Use standard Markdown or HTML image tags in MDX.

## Markdown syntax

```mdx
![Sample image](/images/sample.jpg)
```

![Sample image](/images/sample.jpg)

## HTML syntax

```html
<img src="/images/sample.jpg" width="640" />
```

<img src="/images/sample.jpg" width="640" />

## Where image assets should live

- place assets under `public/`
- reference them as absolute site paths (`/images/sample.jpg`)

## Tips

- always include meaningful alt text in Markdown syntax
- avoid very large images for docs readability and load performance
- use explicit width/height on `<img>` when layout stability matters
