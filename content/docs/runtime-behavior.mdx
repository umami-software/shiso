title: Runtime Behavior
---

This page explains how Shiso resolves, compiles, and renders docs content at runtime.

## Route generation (`generateStaticParams`)

For the `docs` section, routes are generated from normalized navigation slugs in `src/docs.json`.

- `index` -> `/docs` (empty optional catch-all params)
- `a/b` -> `/docs/a/b`

## Content loading and file resolution

For each page reference in `src/docs.json` navigation, Shiso resolves one of:

- `content/docs/<slug>.mdx`
- `content/docs/<slug>.md`

Missing files fail the build early.

## Compilation pipeline (`parseFile`)

Each page is compiled with:

- `remark-gfm`
- heading extraction for page anchor links
- `rehype-slug`
- `rehype-highlight`

Compiled output is cached by file path to avoid repeated compile work for the same page.

## Docs context injected per page

When rendering docs pages, Shiso attaches:

- active tab list
- grouped side navigation sections
- current section label
- previous/next page links
- heading anchors for "On this page"

## Metadata behavior (`generateMetadata`)

For docs pages, metadata title resolves as:

1. frontmatter `title` (if present), else
2. normalized page label from slug

Then appends docs title from `src/docs.json`:

- `name` when present
- otherwise `Shiso`

## Failure modes

Build fails early when:

- `src/docs.json` is missing valid navigation
- `navigation` is missing or contains no pages
- duplicate page slugs are detected
- page file references cannot be resolved from `content/docs`
