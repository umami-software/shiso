Use this page when something in your docs is not rendering as expected.

## A page does not show up

Check these first:

1. The page slug is listed in `src/docs.json`.
2. The file exists under `content/docs`.
3. The slug matches the file path.

Examples:

- `"installation"` -> `content/docs/installation.mdx`
- `"components/tabs"` -> `content/docs/components/tabs.mdx`

## The sidebar is wrong or empty

Usually this means a navigation typo.

Check:

1. `navigation` exists in `src/docs.json`.
2. Each tab/group has valid `pages`.
3. No duplicate page slugs.

## Build fails after editing `src/docs.json`

Common causes:

- Missing page file referenced in `pages`
- Duplicate slug entries
- Invalid object structure in navigation

## "On this page" links are missing

This section appears only when the page has headings.

Add headings like:

```md
## Section title
### Subsection
```

## Page title is not what I expect

Title priority is:

1. frontmatter `title`
2. page label in `src/docs.json`

If neither is set, the slug is used.
