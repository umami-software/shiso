title: Writing content
---

Write docs as `.mdx` (or `.md`) files under `content/docs` and reference them in
`src/docs.json` navigation.

## File format

Each docs page usually starts with frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: "Title of page"
description: "Optional description"
---

Welcome to Shiso.
```

## Recommended frontmatter keys

- `title`: used for page heading and metadata fallback
- `description`: optional intro text shown near the title

## MDX support

You can use standard Markdown plus React components directly in content:

```mdx
<Note>
  You can mix Markdown and components in the same page.
</Note>
```

## Available component surface in MDX

Shiso injects both:

- all exported `@umami/react-zen` components
- built-in Mintlify-style docs components (`Tabs`, `Callout`, `ResponseField`, etc.)

## Heading anchors and right rail

Heading IDs are generated and used for:

- anchor links
- right-side "On this page" navigation

Use meaningful heading text so anchors are readable.

## File organization conventions

- keep one concept per page
- use nested folders for nested routes (`components/tabs.mdx` -> `/docs/components/tabs`)
- prefer stable file slugs to avoid broken internal links
