description: A simple guide to getting your docs site running.

Shiso is powered by Markdown and MDX.
You edit content files, define navigation once, and the site renders your docs at `/docs`.

## What you can do

- Write docs pages in Markdown or MDX
- Organize pages with one navigation file
- Use built-in docs UI components like callouts, tabs, steps, and cards
- Preview everything locally at `/docs`

## Quick setup path

1. Follow [Installation](/docs/installation) to run the app locally.
2. Use [Configuration](/docs/configuration) to set your docs name and navigation.
3. Add content files under `content/docs`.
4. Run locally and confirm your pages and sidebar look right.

## Daily workflow

1. Create or edit a page in `content/docs`.
2. Add that page slug to `src/docs.json`.
3. Refresh `/docs` and verify page order and links.
