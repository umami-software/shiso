title: Configuration
description: Set your docs name, navigation, and page structure.
---

Shiso uses one docs config file: `src/docs.json`.
For most teams, setup is just naming the docs site and defining page navigation.

## Minimal example

```json
{
  "theme": "mint",
  "name": "My Docs",
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Documentation",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting started",
            "pages": ["index", "installation", "configuration"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you want editor autocomplete, you can also add:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://mintlify.com/docs.json"
}
```

## Fields you will actually edit

- `name`: your docs/site title
- `navigation`: the sidebar and top-level sections
- `theme`: keep `"mint"` unless you have a reason to change it
- `contentDir` (optional): defaults to `./src/content`

## How page slugs map to files

Every value in `navigation...pages` must match a file in `src/content/docs`.

- `"index"` -> `src/content/docs/index.mdx` (or `.md`)
- `"installation"` -> `src/content/docs/installation.mdx` (or `.md`)
- `"components/index"` -> `src/content/docs/components/index.mdx` (or `.md`)

Those slugs become routes like:

- `index` -> `/docs`
- `components/index` -> `/docs/components`
- `components/callout` -> `/docs/components/callout`

## Common setup issues

- A page is listed in navigation but the file does not exist.
- A file exists but was never added to `navigation`.
- A nested slug path does not match the folder structure.
