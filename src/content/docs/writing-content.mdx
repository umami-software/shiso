title: Tracker functions
---

The Umami tracker exposes a function that you can call on your website if you want
more control over your tracking. By default everything is automatically collected, but you can
disable this using `data-auto-track="false"` and sending the data yourself.
See [Tracker configuration](/docs/tracker-configuration).

## Functions

```js
umami.track(payload: object);

umami.track(event_name: string, event_data: object);

umami.identify(session_data: object);
```

## Pageviews

Tracks a page view.

```js
umami.track();
```

By default the tracker automatically collects the following properties:

- `hostname` - Hostname of server
- `language` - Browser language
- `referrer` - Page referrer
- `screen` - Screen dimensions (eg. 1920x1080)
- `title` - Page title
- `url` - Page url
- `website` - Website ID (required)

If you wish to send your own custom payload, pass in an object to the function:

```js
umami.track({ website: 'e676c9b4-11e4-4ef1-a4d7-87001773e9f2', url: '/home', title: 'Home page' });
```

The above will only send the properties `website`, `url` and `title`. If you want to include existing properties, pass in a function:

```js
umami.track(props => ({ ...props, url: '/home', title: 'Home page' }));
```

## Events

Tracks an event with a given name.

```js
umami.track('signup-button');
```

## Event Data

Tracks an event with dynamic data.

```js
umami.track('signup-button', { name: 'newsletter', id: 123 });
```

When tracking events, the default properties are included in the payload.
This is equivalent to running:

```js
umami.track(props => ({
  ...props,
  name: 'signup-button',
  data: {
    name: 'newsletter',
    id: 123,
  },
}));
```

## Event Data Limits

Event Data can work with any JSON data. There are a few rules in place to maintain performance.

- Numbers have a max precision of 4.
- Strings have a max length of 500.
- Arrays are converted to a String, with the same max length of 500.
- Objects have a max of 50 properties. Arrays are considered 1 property.

## Session Data

Tracks a session with dynamic data. You would call the identity function from the tracker script to save data about the current session.

```js
umami.identify({ email: 'bob@aol.com' });
```
