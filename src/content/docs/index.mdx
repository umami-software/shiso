## What is Shiso?

Shiso is a lightweight framework that helps you build websites effortlessly by letting you focus on
what matters mostâ€”your content. It handles the design, layout, and functionality for you, so all
you need to do is write in Markdown.

With built-in support for MDX, you can seamlessly embed React components within your content,
making it easy to add interactive elements.

Right out of the box, Shiso provides pre-designed templates for **documentation** and **blogs**, and it
integrates smoothly with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for a fast, modern development experience.
