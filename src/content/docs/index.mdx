## What is Shiso?

Shiso is a lightweight framework that helps you build websites effortlessly by letting you focus on
what matters most—your content. It handles the design, layout, and functionality for you, so all
you need to do is write in Markdown.

With built-in support for MDX, you can seamlessly embed React components within your content,
making it easy to add interactive elements.

Right out of the box, Shiso provides pre-designed templates for **documentation**, and it
integrates smoothly with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for a fast, modern development experience.
