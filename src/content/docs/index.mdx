## What is Shiso?

Shiso lets you quickly build websites by focusing on writing content. Shiso takes care of the
design, layout and functionality while you provide the content through Markdown files. You can also
embed React components into your content with MDX.

Out of the box, Shiso provides templates for docs and blogs and works with [Next.js](/docs/).
